# Milestone v1.1.0 Audit Report

## Conclusion

Status is **gaps_found**. Most milestone work is complete and verified at phase level, but one critical user-flow gap remains: backup import/export is implemented in data layer and not exposed in UI, so users cannot actually run backup/restore.

## Scope

- Phase 1: Policy Compliance
- Phase 2: Bug Fixes
- Phase 3: Backup & Data Integrity
- Phase 4: UI Polish

All 4 phases have VERIFICATION reports and phase-level status `passed`.

## Cross-Phase Integration

- Connected integrations: 5
- Missing integrations: 1
- Broken E2E flows: 1

### Critical Gaps

1. `utils/backup.ts` exports `exportBackupData` and `importBackupData`, but no UI component imports/calls them.
2. User flow "backup import/export" breaks at trigger step (no button/menu/entry in settings or actions).

### Non-Critical Gaps / Debt

- `components/input/input.vue` still uses hardcoded rgba tokens.
- `components/context-menu/context-menu.vue` still uses hardcoded rgba tokens.

## Evidence

1. `utils/backup.ts`: backup export/import functions implemented.
2. `components/setting-modal/setting-modal.vue`: no backup section or backup actions.
3. `components/actions/actions.vue`: no import/export backup action button.
4. `.planning/phases/03-backup-data-integrity/03-VERIFICATION.md`: notes no UI wiring for backup functions.
5. `components/searcher/searcher.vue`: wired to `chrome.search.query()`.
6. `components/site-modal/site-modal.vue`: URL validation allows only safe protocols.
7. `utils/wallpaper-providers.ts` + `vite.config.ts`: dev proxy flow wired.

## Recommended Next Step

Run `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` to create one focused phase that adds backup import/export UI entry points, file selection, and error feedback wiring to `ImportBackupResult`.
